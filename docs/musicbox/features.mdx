Saving the disc by pressing *esc* will maintain it editable, but if you save it with *enter* it will be locked and signed by you, and can't be edited anymore.

  You can change the song **Pitch** by ading `&pitch=1.5` at the end of the URL. The pitch value can be any number between 0.5 (scary low) and 2.0 (chipmunk high). The default pitch is 1.0.

  It will only be changed back to the default pitch if you change the pitch to 1.0, as removing the pitch parameter will not change it back to the default pitch.
