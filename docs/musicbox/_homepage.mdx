# About the Mod
**Music Box** is a Minecraft mod that adds a custom music disc item, allowing you to play any YouTube music in the JukeBox! It is *server compatible*, so you can play music with your friends, add ambient music, create a radio station, and much more!

It is a fork of the Fabric mod [URL Music Discs](https://modrinth.com/mod/url-music-discs), ported to Forge with some improvements and new features.

## Dependencies
- [DeltaBox Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/deltaboxlib)
- [Kotlin For Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/kotlin-for-forge)

# Future
The mod is still in development, as of now it only works with YouTube links, but I am planning to add support for other platforms like Discord, SoundCloud, and more. If you have any suggestions, or found bugs, please let me know.

New disc variants textures are always welcome if you have new ideas!
